# RakutenCodefury ( Barood - Solutions ) 
Rakuten conducted a one day Hackathon at University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering Bangalore on 15th September 2019. This repository consists of the codebase for the entire project made on the day Hackathon. Technological Stack :- Java, MySQL, Ajax, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Description ->**  
Our project is titled as Barood Solutions which provides different APIs and articles as well as different features such as Source Code Rentals or Enhancers, The Merkle Spread DataStructure and others. 


## 1) Source Code Rentals ##

In very simple language it’s like a Github system. But the person with a better commit of the same functionality gets the lead over the other, and not just pushing the changes to the project once a pull request is been raised. 
This system runs the code snippets on a coding engine where the entire backend is hidden at the background only exposing a part of the function which is required to be completed, supplied with the data that is been provided to the function and the output that is expected from the function. 
eg :- For a college project I want a functionality which maps the students who have a doubt in a particular subject to the student who is very good at it in the campus. I need an algorithm which can efficiently do it, not always redirecting the queries to a single person. But to also distribute it intelligently. 
The description could be provided in detail about the problem that needs to be solved eg:-

```
public static HashMap<Student, Student> getMapperList(ArrayList<Students> students) {
                   // Complete the Code Snippet to return the list of mapping of students. 
                   // Parameter : students
                   // You are provided with an ArrayList of the Students along with their expertise 
                   // in different subjects. Etc Etc. 
                   // Return Object type : HashMap<Student, Student> 
                   // Expectations : The map should contain the mapping of students which they will 
                   // be redirected to when asked the doubts etc etc etc. 
}
```

The code snippets for the same could be provided by different registered users and run separately without compromising with the backend. The best ones can be chosen for further testing and selection whether to embed in backend or not, thus improving the efficiency of some of the processes and also providing opportunities to enthusiastic individuals. 

## 2) Merkle Spread ##

This was the DataStructure that we thought of which will be helpful in spreading our software to a larger crowd. Here a registered person can associate some other user with him on a given project. 

Whenever the associator associates a good programmer or coder with him on the project he gets some credit points proportional to the rating of the programmer involved. And ultimately if the code snippet gets accepted by the company or the person who put forward the problem statement, the overall Credit for the code contributed will be distributed among the members in the desired ratio. Thus the associator will have a credit advantage for associating better programmers, which will also improve the code efficiency and quality as better minds are making those codes. 

The contributor of the codes specifies the price of the code in terms of MerkleCoins ( some units coined by us ). He always can alter the price in case someone else is providing a code with similar efficiency at a lesser rate. 
This overall system improves code snippets as well as decreases cost of building projects. 
Freelancing of codes can be made easy and cheaper. 

## 3) Additional Support -> ##

To lure the customers provide them with some benefits which they get upon registrations. Dedicated articles, services, APIs etc. How Jio has dedicated applications like – JioCinema, JioSaavn, similar to that. In our application we gave link to different articles websites that I build during my Engineering Life :-
